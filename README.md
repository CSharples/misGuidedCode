# misGuidedCode
This is the code of our entry to the 2020 GMTK game jam, misGuided. The game itself it a top down shooter which can be found here (https://lampwick.itch.io/misguided) and played in browser. All the code was written in 48 hours, so there's certainly lots of optimization to be done!

We shared programming responsibilites, so it's a little difficult to cleanly divide who wrote what exactly.
